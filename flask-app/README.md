problem statement:- 

 Okteto lets you develop your applications directly in Kubernetes. This way you can:

 Reduce local setup and eliminate integration issues by developing the same way your application runs in production
        Test your application as fast as you type code, without typing either docker or kubectl in your inner loop cycle
        No more CPU cycles wasted in your machine. Hardware and network just limited by the power of the cloud
